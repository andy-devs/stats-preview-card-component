## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   See all the contents

## My process

### Built with

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox a bit better, how to use a filter in css, how to do a simple adaptive design for mobile devices. That's my first small project :)

```css
.container-picture img {
    filter: invert(25%) sepia(65%) saturate(410%) hue-rotate(233deg) brightness(
            98%
        ) contrast(103%);
}
```

### Continued development

I think I'll continue practicing HTML and CSS by doing simple challenges on Frontend Mentor. And then I'll go on to website layouts.
